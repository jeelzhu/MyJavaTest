key design thoughts:

Given n x n grid on which zombies and creatures live, 2 dimensions array is used to represent grid in the code.
Initially I thought there is only one victim on each grid square, in contrast, the problem description said any number
of zombies and creatures may occupy the same grid square, I realised that the data structure like list must be used on
each cell of 2 dimensions array.

Furthermore, others the zombies move in a certain order, the first newly created zombie move first, the second newly
created zombie move second and so on. I need to track down the sequence of infection order for others the victims,
 First In First Out approach is used here, I decided to use queue to implement it.

At the end, the program need to produce the scores and others the final position of the zombies , others the frozen zombie are
retained in the list.
